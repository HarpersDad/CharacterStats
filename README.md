<h2>About</h2>

- A character and enemy stats program I created just to see how this type of system works.<br>
- If someone needs to use this, feel free to do so.<br>

<h2>Features</h2>

- added stat buffs for items and equipment.<br>
- if a player is created with no data, the following will be set: name - Vagabond, job - vagrant, sex - other.<br>
- current job classes are: defender, ranger, fighter, mage, thief, vagrant.<br>
- starting equipment.<br>
- simple UI that allows the user to choose a character and level them up.<br>
- save feature that allows for multiple character stats and equipment to be saved and recalled.<br>
- character creation menu.<br>

<h2>In code but not useable</h2>

- inventory.<br>
- equippable items.<br>
- item creation.<br>
- enemy stats and creation.<br>
- enchantment system.<br>
- status afflictions.<br>
- damage multiplier system.<br>

<h2>Recently Added</h2>

- added more armor set options when creating a character.<br>
- reorganized the code so that it is easier/harder to follow.<br>
- added equipment info when a user hovers over an item's name.<br>
- fixed an equipment issue that added gear buffs more than once.<br>
- ui now shows the amount of gold that the selected player is holding.<br>
- changed ui background to be blue with white text.<br>

<h2>Issues</h2>

- if you create a new character then load, there is an out of bounds error.<br>
